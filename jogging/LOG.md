# Jogging log

Newest at the bottom. One entry per step: date, piece/step, model, outcome.

## 2026-10-12 17:24 icon/spec (opus)
Wrote `jogging/specs/icon.md`. The generator is a dependency-free Node script emitting
VectorDrawables and an SVG preview rather than Pillow rasters, so CI can check the committed
icons match the script. Added build-1 (generator and art), build-2 (device, release build,
docs) and review, all Sonnet.

## 2026-10-13 00:18 icon/spec-review (opus)
Spec holds up against the goals and the code. Fixed: `main` must not run on import, or the
drift test regenerates before comparing and can never fail; the notification gap limit is
now a tested constant; the group transform is pinned down; the preview recipe works around
headless Edge's minimum window width; CLAUDE.md's "release script tests" wording joins the docs list.

## 2026-10-13 00:23 test-data-layer/spec (opus)
Wrote `jogging/specs/test-data-layer.md`. Layers are selected by the runner's `package`
argument rather than custom Gradle tasks; `DATABASE_VERSION` and `ALL_MIGRATIONS` let a chain
test cover every migration from v1; CI adds an API 26 (minSdk, oldest SQLite) emulator job,
and connected runs must set `ANDROID_SERIAL` since they uninstall the app. Added build-1
(scaffolding, migration tests), build-2 (DAO, repository tests), build-3 (CI, docs) and review, all Sonnet.
