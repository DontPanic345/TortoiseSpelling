# Jogging log

Newest at the bottom. One entry per step: date, piece/step, model, outcome.

Wrote `jogging/specs/icon.md`. The generator is a dependency-free Node script emitting
VectorDrawables and an SVG preview rather than Pillow rasters, so CI can check the committed
icons match the script. Added build-1 (generator and art), build-2 (device, release build,
docs) and review, all Sonnet.

## 2026-10-13 00:18 icon/spec-review (opus)
Spec holds up against the goals and the code. Fixed: `main` must not run on import, or the
drift test regenerates before comparing and can never fail; the notification gap limit is
now a tested constant; the group transform is pinned down; the preview recipe works around
headless Edge's minimum window width; CLAUDE.md's "release script tests" wording joins the docs list.
